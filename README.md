# The Open Source Leftist Bible (Working Name)

Please keep in mind that this project is in the very early stages of development. Most of the necessary notes do not exist, and of those that do exist, they are mostly filled with dummy information and manual links. The discord is unfinished and unorganized. For now, please post in the forum channel for the relevant document in the discord to merge your changes. 

ALSO THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT FINISHED, just a basic framework is there. 
 
# Viewing and Editing the Documents

This project uses Obsidian, a free note-taking app, to organize its documents. This guide will walk you through how to view and contribute to the project, even if you're not very familiar with computers or software like Obsidian and GitHub.

## Viewing the Documents (Just Reading)

If you only want to read the documents, here's how: (note, one of our core goals is to make this more accessable, eventually we will have a website available to view these documents, but for now this is the process, and it requires some computer literacy)

1.  **Download and Install Obsidian:**

    Obsidian is like a digital notebook. You'll need it to view the project files.

    *   Go to the Obsidian website: [https://obsidian.md/download](https://obsidian.md/download)
    *   Click the download button for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
    *   Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

2.  **Download the Project Files (as a ZIP):**

    You'll need to download a copy of the project files from GitHub.

    *   On this project's GitHub page, look for a green button that says "Code". Click it.
    *   A menu will pop up. Choose "Download ZIP". This will download a compressed folder containing all the project files.

3.  **Extract the Downloaded Files:**

    The downloaded file will be a "ZIP" file. You need to "extract" it to access the files inside.

    *   Find the ZIP file you just downloaded (it's likely in your "Downloads" folder).
    *   Right-click on the ZIP file.
    *   Choose "Extract All..." (on Windows) on mac just open it and it should extract to a folder next to the zip.
    *   Choose a location to extract the files (your "Documents" folder is a good choice). Click "Extract".

4.  **Open the Project in Obsidian:**

    Now, open Obsidian:

    *   On the Obsidian welcome screen, you'll see a section called "Open folder as vault". Click on it.
    *   Navigate to the folder where you extracted the project files (from step 3) and select that folder. Click "Select Folder".

5.  **Explore the Documents:**

    Obsidian will now display the project's documents. You can click on the file names in the left sidebar to open and read them. The "Organization" section of this README will help you understand how everything is structured.

## Editing and Contributing to the Documents

**Before making *any* changes, please carefully read the [Contribution Guidelines](LINK TO CONTRIBUTING.md). They explain how to contribute effectively and ensure your changes are accepted. It is *essential* you read these first.**

If you're ready to contribute: (Note, this is a higher barrier to entry than something like wikipedia, we use this platform for many reasons, most of which involve hosting, however, one bonus is that a slightly higher barrier to entry is helpful in combatting low effort trolls. If you have some experiance with computers this should not be difficult, if you are struggling ask for help in the discord and someone will help you). 

1.  **Fork the Project on GitHub:**

    "Forking" creates your own personal copy of the project on GitHub. This allows you to make changes without affecting the original project.

    *   Sign up for a github account
    *   On this project's GitHub page, look for the "Fork" button in the top right corner and click it.

2.  **Clone Your Fork:**

    GitHub Desktop makes managing your changes and contributing back much easier, especially for beginners.

    *   If you don't have it, download and install GitHub Desktop: [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)
    *   Open GitHub Desktop.
    *   Click "File" -> "Clone Repository".
    *   Select the "GitHub.com" tab.
    *   Find your forked copy of this project in the list and select it.
    *   Choose a local path where you want to store the project files on your computer and click "Clone".

3.  **Open the Project in Obsidian:**

    Now, open Obsidian:

    *   Launch Obsidian.
    *   On the Obsidian welcome screen, you'll see a section called "Open folder as vault". Click on it.
    *   Navigate to the folder where you cloned the project (either using GitHub Desktop or the command line) and select that folder. Click "Select Folder".

4.  **Make Your Edits in Obsidian:**

    Now you can make your changes to the project documents in Obsidian.

5.  **Commit Your Changes (Using GitHub Desktop):**

    *   In GitHub Desktop, you'll see a list of changed files.
    *   Write a clear and concise commit message describing your changes (e.g., "Fixed typos in introduction section").
    *   Click "Commit to `<your_branch_name>`".

    *   You should see a button that says "Compare & pull request". Click it.
    *   Review your changes and write a clear description of your pull request.
    *   Click "Create pull request".

Materialism is the idea that the most important things in the world are the things we can see and touch. Unlike Idealism, which focuses on ideas, Materialism believes that the physical world is what really shapes how we live.

- **Focus on the Physical World:** Everything we see, touch, and experience is made up of matter and energy. Ideas and thoughts are important, but they are a product of the physical brain and the world around us.
- **The Impact of the Physical Environment:** Materialists believe that the world around us shapes how we live. For example, the invention of the wheel made it much easier to travel and trade, which changed how people lived and worked.
- **Human Needs and Survival:** Materialists believe that people need basic things like food and shelter to survive. They think a good society is one that can take care of its people.

**Example:** Imagine building a house. Idealism would focus on the architect's plans and the overall look of the house. Materialism, on the other hand, would focus on the materials used to build the house, like wood, bricks, and concrete, and how they are put together to make it strong and safe.

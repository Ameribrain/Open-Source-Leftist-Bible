Hegel believed in Idealism, which means he thought that ideas are the most powerful things in the world.

- **Ideas drive change:** Hegel thought that history is mostly about how ideas change and how those changes affect what happens in the world.
- **The "World Spirit":** Hegel thought that history follows a kind of plan or pattern. It's like there's a hidden force that guides us towards a better understanding of the world.
- **Progress towards perfection:** Hegel believed that history is always moving forward, getting closer and closer to perfection, and that history is always getting better, and this happens because of how ideas change and grow.

**Example:** Imagine a game where you have to build the tallest tower. You start with simple ideas (like using just a few blocks). Then you get better ideas (like stacking blocks in a certain way). Each new idea helps you build a taller and stronger tower. Hegel believed that history is like this â€“ we're constantly building a better world through the power of ideas.

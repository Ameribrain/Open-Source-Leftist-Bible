Hegel noticed that history often follows a pattern of things changing as ideas clashed:

1. **Thesis:** This is like the starting point, an idea or a way things are.
2. **Antithesis**: This is an idea that argues against the first idea. 
3. **Synthesis:** This is a new idea or way of doing things that comes from the clash between the thesis and antithesis. Â 

**For Example:**

- **Thesis:** Everyone agrees that the Earth is flat.
- **Antithesis:** Some people start to question this, presenting evidence that it's round.
- **Synthesis:** A new understanding emerges: the Earth is indeed round.

Hegel believed that this pattern of thesis-antithesis-synthesis repeats throughout history, leading to progress and a deeper understanding of the world.

2. **[Materialism](Materialism 101 - Ideas Rule the World)**

Dialectical Materialism puts these two ideas together, and flips Hegal's Idealism on its head. Marx noticed that history isn't just about ideas, but also about how people work, how they make money, and how they use technology.

**Just Like Hegel's Dialectics:**

- **The Thesis:** Imagine a society where everyone works on a farm. The Farm is not owned by the farmers, in return for their work, the farmers receive a portion of what the farm produces.
    
- **The Antithesis:** New technology is invented, like machines that can do the work of many people. This creates a conflict, or an "antithesis." The owner of the farm can fire most of the farmers, and still get more at harvest. 
    
- **The Synthesis:** This conflict leads to changes. People might start to demand better working conditions, or they might even try to create a new system where everyone shares the wealth created by the machines. This is the "synthesis" - a new way of organizing society that comes from the clash between the old way and the new technology.
    

**Dialectical Materialism believes that this process happens again and again throughout history.** As technology changes, as people's needs change, and as societies grow, there are always new conflicts and new ways of organizing things.

**Example:** A house is built with wood, iron, and stone. While Hegel would focus on the blueprints and design, and Materialists would focus on the materials, process, and result. Marx would focus on how people use the house in different ways: for sleeping, eating, and working. Over time, the house may need repairs or improvements. Marx believed these changes are driven by the needs of the people who live in the house and the materials/tools they can use.
